## Technologies
I used React library, Css, Node, Express, MongoDB, Firebase Storage.

## Approach
The client side of this app is pretty simple. Whent this app starts, it make a http request to the server side to get all the products using React query and store those in the memory cache and serve thoroughout the app. Then the user can browse all different types of products and can get information about any product.
